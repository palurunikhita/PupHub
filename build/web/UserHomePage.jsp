<h2 style="color:black;font-size: 26px; font-weight: bolder;">Pitbull</h2>
<marquee><p style="font-size: 22px;">Get ready to have your mind blown: Pit Bulls are not actually a breed of dog. The term refers to a variety of breeds, like the American Staffordshire terrier, the Staffordshire bull terrier and other such mixes of dogs.
In the early part of the last century, Pit Bulls were known as “Nanny Dogs”. It may be hard to believe now with all of the bad press they receive, but Pit Bulls were the breed of choice among parents with young children. If you left your kid with a Pit Bull, they were safe!
They were originally bred to drive and catch livestock and to serve as the ideal family companions.
Pit Bulls were not bred as guard dogs because they were too friendly. (!)
They do not have locking jaws. This is a myth!
To piggyback on fact number five: Pit Bulls also don’t have the strongest bite among all dog breeds. German Shepherds and Rottweilers actually have a more powerful bite.</p></marquee>
